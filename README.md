# pdfflipeven: Flip even pages of PDFs

Given how shitty the PDF scanner in the HP `hplip` package is (there is no
way to select side-by-side vs. up-and-down scanning) it is no wonder that
pages in the document feeder get scanned odd pages right, even pages upside
down.

This program fixes that disaster after the fact, flipping even pages upside
down (rotating them 180 degrees).

That is all.

Check `pdfflipeven --help` for information on how to use it.
